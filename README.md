# HacKontext - Time Converter Token Bruteforcer

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83867734/160303319-af26ce2d-2e57-44a2-a94f-5e59d71fd527.png)

## What it does

HacKontext allows to inject HTTP header and body of the active browser tab on specific InfoSec command-line tools in order to improve and speed up their correct usage.

It prevents the user to copy and paste headers and any parameters manually to the tools.

Current tools implemented:
* FFUF
* SQLMap
* TimeVerter
* WFUZZ

Note that these buttons only work on normal web pages, not special pages like `about:debugging`.

Compatible with Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Opera browsers. Tested on Firefox.

## Contribution

If you identify a new command-line tool that takes as input headers and/or body parameters, please propose your ideas!

Thank you
